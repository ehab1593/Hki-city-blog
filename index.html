            Helsinki is the capital and most populous city in Finland. It is
            located on the shore of the Gulf of Finland and serves as the seat
            of the Uusimaa region in southern Finland. Approximately 675,000
            people live in the municipality, with 1.25 million in the capital
            region, and 1.58 million in the metropolitan area. As the most
            populous urban area in Finland, it is the country's most significant
            centre for politics, education, finance, culture, and research.
            Helsinki is situated 80 kilometres (50 mi) to the north of Tallinn,
            Estonia, 360 kilometres (220 mi) to the north of Riga, Latvia, 400
            kilometres (250 mi) to the east of Stockholm, Sweden, and 300
            kilometres (190 mi) to the west of Saint Petersburg, Russia.
            Helsinki has significant historical connections with these four
            cities.

          <h2>The scenery in Helsinki</h2>
          <p>
            While the view in the city is beautiful, the sounds are not as
            lovely as it yet a metropolitan city. Below you'll see an example of
